        <i><strong>Tokyo</strong></i> is a crazy, frenetic, and astounding city.
        Here you can, explore the early morning fish market, visit the Imperial
        Palace, behold beautiful cherry blossoms, party in Tokyo's trendy
        nightlife district, sing karaoke, and eat lots of amazing sushi (it is
        Japan after all).

              Dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken,
              construction of the splendid Meiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū) began in
              1915 and was completed in 1926. Although the original structure
              was destroyed during WWII, it was rebuilt in 1958 and remains one
              of Tokyo's most important religious sites. Surrounded by a
              175-acre evergreen forest that is home to some 120,000 trees
              representing species found across Japan – as well as the
              interesting "wishing tree," on which visitors can write and hang
              their deepest wishes – the shrine's highlights include its Inner
              Precinct (Naien) with its museum containing royal treasures, and
              the Outer Precinct (Gaien). It's in the Outer Precinct that you'll
              find the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery with its superb collection
              of murals relating to the lives of the emperor and empress. Be
              sure to also visit the adjacent Meiji Shrine Inner Garden (Yoyogi
              Gyoen), an attractive public garden complete with a teahouse, iris
              garden, and a pleasant arbor.

              Walk through one of Tokyo's most historic pieces of land when you
              visit the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. Formerly the residence
              of the Naito family during the Edo period (17th-19th centuries),
              it was transferred to the Imperial Family. It is now a national
              garden, which opened in 1949, and is considered to be one of the
              most beautiful in Japan. The garden is considered one of the best
              because it fuses together three types of traditional garden:
              French Formal, English Landscape, and Japanese traditional. It
              also happens to be one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the
              cherry blossoms, as the garden has roughly 1,500 cherry trees.
              You'll also find Himalayan cedars, cypresses, and tulip trees. The
              garden is very popular in the autumn, when the leaves start to
              change to crimson and gold. Other features of the garden include a
              greenhouse, beautiful ponds, and several pavilions.

        >
        <p>
          The world’s first theme park dedicated to the beloved works of Studio
          Ghibli is finally open. It’s not a typical amusement park — there’s no
          roller coasters spraying water, no big-haired princesses waving from
          parade floats — but rather a muted ode to the legendary animation
          company. In comparison to the fanfare of the world’s biggest parks,
          like those run by Disney or Universal Studios, it may not seem like
          much of a grand event, but Ghibli Park signals a quiet departure for
          the 37-year-old studio.
